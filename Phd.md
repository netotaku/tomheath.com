My PhD research was focused on using the Semantic Web to support recommendation-seeking in social networks. Specifically the aim was to: understand how people choose word of mouth information sources from among members of their social networks, and the factors that affect these source-selection decisions; model these processes as computational algorithms so they can be replicated in an online environment; build Semantic Web-based systems that support people in information seeking through their trusted social networks.

During my time at [The Open University](http://www.open.ac.uk/) I was supervised by Professor [Enrico Motta](http://people.kmi.open.ac.uk/motta/), [Professor Marian Petre](http://mcs.open.ac.uk/mp8/) and [Dr Martin Dzbor](http://kmi.open.ac.uk/people/member/martin-dzbor).
